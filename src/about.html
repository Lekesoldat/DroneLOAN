        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          DroneLOAN was founded in 2015 by the norwegian entrepreneur
          Morten Rustad. 
          Formerly, the company consisted of one tiny store
          close to the Norwegian 
          University of Science and Technology
          (NTNU). However, as this is a quickly
          growing industry Morten
          has decided to move his industry online as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main purpose of the web site is to ensure an user-friendly
          experience
          or both renting drones and learn about them. We all
          know that drones
          can be very expensive to purchase, and in such
          a growing industry where
          technology quickly becomes outdated,
          renting will be the best option.
