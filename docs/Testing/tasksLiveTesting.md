# Intention

Our intention is to run several live-testing sessions where the applicant will be asked to perform different tasks. The tasks range from nagivating to a webpage on droneLOAN and retrieving sepcific information, to filling out a rental form for a drone.

When a tasks is being performed it is important that we as the observers take notes of bugs encountered, things not working as intended etc. It is also important to take notes what goes wrong when the user is struggeling with a task.

The live-testing consist of seven different tasks, and a section where the test-subject can comment about the experience (what was good, what was bad, what could be improve etc.)

When you run a test, make a copy of live_test_questions in the folder 'Live Test Questions'. Leave the file in that folder.
