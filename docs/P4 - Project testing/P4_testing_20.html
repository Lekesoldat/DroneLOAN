            <h1>Testing Document</h1>
            <p>
                We chose to split the testing into two different parts: Google form survey and live testing.<br><br>

                With our Google forms, we wanted to gather data on topics such as design, 
                functionality, accessibility, performance and potential changes which could be implemented. 
                In the form, we ask questions such as: 'How pleasing is the appearance?' and 
                'Did ever require more than three clicks to get to your destination?'. 
                After a sufficient number of surveys is submitted, 
                we aim to analyze the data and make potential changes to our site.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_D1JwawavPgOPrw1r89O_TZC3wesyGPUf1aN5Fg2l84/viewform?fbclid=IwAR2dhex0pPLIu6f15Nj8SwxM8LRt-4VhQ_KsApBBw-iomFiw9zoOdDWdzQ4&edit_requested=true">Link to the Google Form</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                The live testing differs from the form survey because in the live testing we ask the test subject 
                to perform different tasks on the website. We aim to see if the design, accessibility, 
                and functionality combined make sense to a person who never has visited the site before, 
                and therefore the person testing is not allowed to browse the site before the tasks begin. 
                We will gather data on things like bugs, slow performing pages etc. We will take notes 
                during the whole live testing process.
            </p>

            <p>
                The live testing consist of seven different tasks, and a 
                section where the test-subject can comment about the experience 
                (what was good, what was bad, what could be improved etc). 
                A detailed list of all the questions can be found 
                <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/magnulho/Courses/IT2085/Project/Documents/Project_P4%20-%20Testing/Testing/tasksLiveTesting.md">here</a>

        <div class="section" id="testAud">
            <h1>Tester Audience</h1>

            <p>
                In P2 we pointed out that our target audience was aimed at the hardcore drone enthusiast, while still reaching out to people 
                who has never experienced drone flying? Therefore in our testing, we focused on gathering data from people in all different ages, fields, and genders.
                75% of our live test subjects do not have a background or are studying computer science.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="testPlat">
            <h1>Testing Platform</h1>
            <p>
                To discover as many bugs and errors as possible, we found it essential for the live testing to take place on different platforms. 
                Therefore we got data from phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="section" id="feedback">
            <h1>Feedback Summary</h1>
            <h3>Live Test</h3>
            <p class='bold'>Find the name of our CEO on the page.</p>
            <p>Intention: Detect problems regarding information accessibility.</p>
            <p>
                One out of twelve participants tried to find the information on the contact page before going to 'About Us'.
                No other issues occurred, and all the other participants found the information immediately.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'> Check out the max flight time of DJI Inspire 2 (Ans: 27 min).</p>
            <p>Intention: Detect problems regarding information accessibility.</p>
            <p>
                One of the mobile participants went back to the landing page and found the correct drone there. 
                However, the participant was unable to open the drone specific page. Then went to 'Our Drones' and found it immediately. 
                All other participants went to 'Our Drones' first try.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Fill out a contact form where you write a message to droneLOAN</p>
            <p>Intention: Detect issues relating to contacting droneLOAN</p>
            <p>
                No participants found this task troublesome.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>From the contact page, access the landing/index-page in just one click</p>
            <p> Intention: Detect if the the droneiconbutton, which loads index.html, works as intended</p>
            <p>
                Every participant understood that the white drone icon was a direct link to the landing page.
                Thus, everyone managed to get to the page in exactly one click - which was the intended purpose.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Fill out a rental form for the drone: Parrot Disco</p>
            <p>Intention: Detect if the the droneiconbutton, which loads index.html, works as intended</p>
            <p>
                A few parts chose to click 'Learn More' rather than 'Rent Now'. Due to how the drone specific page is coded - 
                they both lead to the same page with the rental form at the bottom. The only difference being that the  
                'Rent Now' leads directly to the form whereas with the 'Learn Now' you have to scroll to the bottom. No participants found this challenging.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Intention: Detect any problems regarding playing videos</p>
            <p>Intention: Detect any problems regarding playing videos</p>
            <p>
                No problems occurred during this task.

            <p class='bold'>Get the address of droneLOAN store</p>
            <p>Intention: Detect if the user spots the address in the footer</p>
            <p>
                Only one participant found the information in the footer whereas everyone else found it under the 'About Us'-tab.
                This is not too surprising due to the fact that the footer does not contain the address on the mobile platform.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Additional comments (optional)</p>
            <p>Intention: Take notes of any issues not covered in the questions above</p>
            <p>
                The mobile participants encountered a few minor difficulties due to the fact that the page is not designed for 
                mobile use. The main issue was due to the footer losing its content when scaled under a certain size. Otherwise,
                the participants found the design simple, but yet effective!
            </p>

            <h3>Google Form</h3>

            <p class='bold'>Design</p>
            <p>Questions: What do you think about the design? Do you think the design makes the page easily readable?</p>
            <p>
                The general consensus was that the website was functional and its minimalistic design helped make the site more
                accessible. However, some users would have preferred a more colorful design.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Functionality</p>
            <p>Questions: Did any functionalities positively stand out? Did anything not work as intended?</p>
            <p>
                Many users found the image and video-gallery to be positively standing out. Some users found the text to be
                overlapping and the 'Rent Now'-buttons to not be displayed as intended.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Accessibility</p>
            <p>Questions: How easy is it to navigate through the site? Were you able to navigate destination on the page on
                three clicks or less?
            </p>
            <p>
                As pointed out in the section about the design. Every user reported that they did not need more than three
                clicks to get to a specific destination.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Performance</p>
            <p>Questions: Did anything load too slowly? Is there anything not working as it should?</p>
            <p>
                Some users reported that the videos were loading slowly in the video gallery.
            </p>

            
            <p class='bold'>Ideas and Comments</p>
            <p>Questions: Is there anything the page is lacking? Do you have any further comments?</p>
            <p>Users would like the following functionalities to be added:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>More colors on the website</li>
                <li>Rental prices and information on how long you could rent</li>
                <li>Chatbot</li>
                <li>Drone sorting filer functionality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, users were very pleased with the site and enjoyed the simplicity and accessibility of the page.</p>

        </div>


        <div class="section" id="response">
            <h1>Our Response</h1>

            <p>
                As pointed out earlier, several users reported that they would like to see more colors. 
                We purposefully went for a minimalistic and clean design, which contribute to accessibility. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As stated, some users reported slow video loading speeds, especially in 'Video Gallery'. Loading speeds
                depend on several different factors such as internet speed, and therefore it is hard to tackle this problem.
                It could also be a server issue. 
            </p>

            <h3>Changes we implemented</h3>
            <p>
                We got feedback on the introduction header text on index.html. 
                We changed the text to: At DroneLOAN we do our best to ensure the best rental deals on high-end drones.
                Check out our drones below. Please fill out the form in the contact tab for any inquiry.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many users found the 'Rent Now'-button and other text to not be displaying correctly. 
                We fixed this by essentially redoing the whole 'Our Drones' CSS.
            </p>

            <h3>Functionality to be implemented</h3>
            <p>We plan to implement the following features based on user-feedback:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chatbot</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Though would be practically impossible to do without backend</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Drone sorting filter functionality</li>
                <li>Info on how long you can rent and prices</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="reflection">
            <h1>Self-reflection</h1>

            <h3>Techincal aspects</h3>
                <p>
                    During this project, we have learned a lot about different technologies, such as HTML,
                    CSS and JavaScript. We had to do everything from the ground up, 
                    and therefore we now have a better understanding of these technologies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We also have a much better understanding of Version Control Systems, especially GitHub. 
                    Throughout the project, we have used GitHub to collaborate and work on the same codebase. We decided
                    to use Figma to create a sketch of the whole site, which was very helpful when we started doing the coding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In order to assign tasks between the group members, we decided to use GitHub projects and GitHub issues.
                    This was a great way to get an overview of the tasks needing to be done and tasks completed. 
                </p> 

            <h3>Teamwork</h3>
                <p>
                    During this project, we have learned a lot about teamwork, first of all, the importance of communication. In order
                    to be successful, especially with these coding projects, you need to be proficient at communication. A lot of our conversations was done over 
                    Facebook Messenger, which is far from ideal. It is hard to find previous messages and you can't really search for a 
                    specific message. We could have set up a Slack channel which is a better platform for exchanging information. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overall things went pretty smoothly since most of us have been coding in HTML, CSS, and JS before. We managed to 
                    cooperate well as a group which made the process easier. There were no discrepancies between group members which complicated the project.
                </p>

            <h3>Project flow</h3>
                <p>           
                    The group has been very responsible and held the team contract exceptionally well where each individual has done their part.
                    While this is true, there has encountered quite a few different roadblocks on the way. Firstly, our initial scheduling-program,
                    Monday, appeared to only be free for a couple of weeks so we switched to GitHub projects. Secondly, we started out designing the sketches 
                    for the website in Adobe XD, from a recommendation from a group member. Unfortunately, it was nearly impossible to work on the same 
                    project as there was no functionality for copying others design into the master branch. 
                    Thus we ended up with completing the whole sketch in Figma where all the members could work simultaneously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the site, layout and advanced features were finished way before the deadline which was superb. Nevertheless, one of the
                    more elementary features of the side, the responsiveness, would at the end seem to be the more challenging aspect of finishing the project.
                    This arose from early miss-judges and lack of coding skills when starting the project, and thus trailing all the way to the end.
                    Luckily as we were far ahead of the project we had time to fix all major difficulties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All in all, the project went fluently due to competent, responsible group members.
                </p>
            <h3>Project thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    We found ourselves to be spending a lot more time writing on P2, P3_changes, and P4 rather than coding. 
                    As a result, we feel that we did not learn as much coding as we could have if the project had been structured differently.
                    In spite of this, we understand that the work we did on planning and testing is important and often essential for a project like this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to point out that the fact that we could not use flexbox, severely slowed down the coding process. Flexbox is an essential part
                    of modern web development, and we see few reasons why not to use this feature in this project and IT2805 in general. In addition, it would be greatly
                    appreciated if we could use JSON.
