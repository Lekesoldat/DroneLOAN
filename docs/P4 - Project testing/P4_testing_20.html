            <p>
                A brief summary of the questionnaire you send out to testers, as well
                as the link to the Google Form you used. Don't forget to ask your client to test the website.

            <h1>Tester Audience</h1>

            <p>
                A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the
                website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of your
                tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% college students, 46% school
                administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can do the same. If you were able
                to do live testing with a few users, describe that as well
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="testPlat">
            <h1>Testing Platform</h1>
            <p>
                A summary of the different platforms (devices and browsers) that your
                testers used.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="section" id="feedback">
            <h1>Feedback Summary</h1>
            <p>
                A summary of the feedback you received organized by question type
                (design, navigation, content, usability, etc.). Highlight both positive comments and
                thoughtful criticism, your client's testimonial, etc.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="section" id="response">
            <h1>Our Response</h1>
            <p>
                Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what you
                could do (once the class is over) to address this feedback with changes in your design or
                implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or suggestions for
                improvements are difficult or impossible to tackle.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section" id="reflection">
            <h1>Self-reflection</h1>
            <p>
                Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you
                learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the nuts-and-bolts of
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this seriously and be thoughtful
                about your comments, but there is no right or wrong answer here, so don't feel that you
                have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to hear.
