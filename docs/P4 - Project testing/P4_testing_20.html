            <h1>Testing Document</h1>

            <p>
                A brief summary of the questionnaire you send out to testers, as well
                as the link to the Google Form you used. Don't forget to ask your client to test the website.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                We chose to split the testing in two different parts: Google form survey and live testing.<br><br>

                With our Google forms we wanted to gather data on topics such as design, functionality, accessibility,
                performance and potential changes which could be implemented. In the form we ask questions such as: 
                'How pleasing is the apperance?' and 'Did ever require more than three clicks to get to your desitination?'.
                After a sufficent number of surveys is submitted, we aim to analyse the data and make potential changes 
                to our site.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_D1JwawavPgOPrw1r89O_TZC3wesyGPUf1aN5Fg2l84/viewform?fbclid=IwAR2dhex0pPLIu6f15Nj8SwxM8LRt-4VhQ_KsApBBw-iomFiw9zoOdDWdzQ4&edit_requested=true">Link
                    to the Google Form</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                The live testing differs from the form survey, because in the live testing we ask the test subject to 
                perform different tasks on the website. We aim to see if the design, accessibility and functionality combined make sense 
                to a person who never have visited the site before, and therefore the person testing is not allowed to browse the site before the 
                tasks begin. We will gather data on things like bugs, slow performing pages etc. We will take notes during the whole live testing process.
            </p>

            <p>
                The live testing consist of seven different tasks, and a section where the test-subject can comment about the experience 
                (what was good, what was bad, what could be improve etc). A detailed list of all the questions can be found in <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/magnulho/Courses/IT2085/Project/Documents/Project_P4%20-%20Testing/Testing/tasksLiveTesting.md">here</a>

        <div class="section" id="testAud">
            <h1>Tester Audience</h1>

            <p>
                A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the
                website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of your
                tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% college students, 46% school
                administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can do the same. If you were able
                to do live testing with a few users, describe that as well
            </p>

        <div class="section" id="testPlat">
            <h1>Testing Platform</h1>
            <p>
                A summary of the different platforms (devices and browsers) that your
                testers used.

            <p>Intention: Detect problems regarding information accessibility.</p>
            <p>
                One out of twele participants tried to find the information on the contact page before going to 'About Us'.
                No other issues occured, and all the other participants found the information immidiatly.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'> Check out the max flight time of DJI Inspire 2 (Ans: 27 min).</p>
            <p>Intention: Detect problems regarding information accessibility.</p>
            <p>
               One of the mobile participants went back to the landing page and found the correct drone there. However, the participant
               was unable to open the drone specific page. Then went to 'Our Drones' and found it immidiatly. All other participantsw
               went to 'Our Drones' first try.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Fill out a contact form where you write a message to droneLOAN</p>
            <p>Intention: Detect issues relating to contacting droneLOAN</p>
            <p>
                No participants found this task troublesome.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>From the contact page, access the landing/index-page in just one click</p>
            <p> Intention: Detect if the the droneiconbutton, which loads index.html, works as intended</p>
            <p>
               Every participant understood that the white drone icon was a direct link to the landing page.
               Thus, everyone managed to get to the page in exactly one click - which was the inteded purpose.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Fill out a rental form for the drone: Parrot Disco</p>
            <p>Intention: Detect if the the droneiconbutton, which loads index.html, works as intended</p>
            <p>
                A few partic chose to click 'Learn More' rather than 'Rent Now'. Due to how the drone specific page is 
                coded - they both lead to the same page with the rental form at the bottom. The only difference being that the  
                'Rent Now' leads directly to the form whereas with the 'Learn Now' you have to scroll to the bottom. No participants
                found this challenging.

            <p>Intention: Detect if the user spots the address in the footer</p>
            <p>
                Only one participant found the information in the footer whereas everyone else found it under the 'About Us'-tab.
                This is not too surprising due to the fact that the footer does not contain the address on mobile platform.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Additional comments (optional)</p>
            <p>Intention: Take notes of any issues not covered in the questions above</p>
            <p>
                The mobile participants encountered a few minor difficulties due to the fact that the page is not designed for 
                mobile use. The main issue was due to the footer losing its content when scaled under a certain size. Otherwise,
                the participants found the disign simple, but yet effective!
            </p>

            <h3>Google Form</h3>

            <p class='bold'>Design</p>
            <p>Questions: What do you think about the design? Do you think the design makes the page easily readable?</p>
            <p>
                The general consensus was that the web site was functional and its minimalistic design helped make the site more
                accessible. However, some users would have preferred a more colorful design.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Functionality</p>
            <p>Questions: Did any functionalities positively stand out? Did anything not work as intended?</p>
            <p>
                Many users found the image and video-gallery to be positively standing out. Some users found the text to be
                overlapping and the 'Rent Now'-buttons to not be displaying as intended.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Accessibility</p>
            <p>Questions: How easy is it to navigate through the site? Were you able to navigate destination on the page on
                three clicks or less?
            </p>
            <p>
                As pointed out in the section about the design. Every user reported that they did not need more than three
                clicks to get to a specific destination.
            </p>

            <p class='bold'>Performance</p>
            <p>Questions: Did anything load too slowly? Is there anything not working as it should?</p>
            <p>
                Some users reported that the videos were loading slowly in the video gallery.
            </p>

            
            <p class='bold'>Ideas and Comments</p>
            <p>Questions: Is there anything the page is lacking? Do you have any further comments?</p>
            <p>Users would like the following functionalities to be added:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>More colors on the website</li>
                <li>Rental prices and information on how long you could rent</li>
                <li>Chatbot</li>
                <li>Drone sorting filer functionality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, users were very pleased with the site and enjoyed the simplicity and accessibility of the page.</p>

                Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you
                learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the nuts-and-bolts of
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this seriously and be thoughtful
                about your comments, but there is no right or wrong answer here, so don't feel that you
                have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to hear.
