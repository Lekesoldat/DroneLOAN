            <h1>Testing Document</h1>

            <p>
                A brief summary of the questionnaire you send out to testers, as well
                as the link to the Google Form you used. Don't forget to ask your client to test the website.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                We chose to split the testing in two different parts: Google form survey and live testing.<br><br>

                With our Google forms we wanted to gather data on topics such as design, functionality, accessibility,
                performance and potential changes which could be implemented. In the form we ask questions such as: 
                'How pleasing is the apperance?' and 'Did ever require more than three clicks to get to your desitination?'.
                After a sufficent number of surveys is submitted, we aim to analyse the data and make potential changes 
                to our site.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_D1JwawavPgOPrw1r89O_TZC3wesyGPUf1aN5Fg2l84/viewform?fbclid=IwAR2dhex0pPLIu6f15Nj8SwxM8LRt-4VhQ_KsApBBw-iomFiw9zoOdDWdzQ4&edit_requested=true">Link
                    to the Google Form</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                The live testing differs from the form survey, because in the live testing we ask the test subject to 
                perform different tasks on the website. We aim to see if the design, accessibility and functionality combined make sense 
                to a person who never have visited the site before, and therefore the person testing is not allowed to browse the site before the 
                tasks begin. We will gather data on things like bugs, slow performing pages etc. We will take notes during the whole live testing process.
            </p>

            <p>
                The live testing consist of seven different tasks, and a section where the test-subject can comment about the experience 
                (what was good, what was bad, what could be improve etc). A detailed list of all the questions can be found in <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/magnulho/Courses/IT2085/Project/Documents/Project_P4%20-%20Testing/Testing/tasksLiveTesting.md">here</a>

        <div class="section" id="testAud">
            <h1>Tester Audience</h1>

            <p>
                A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the
                website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of your
                tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% college students, 46% school
                administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can do the same. If you were able
                to do live testing with a few users, describe that as well
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="testPlat">
            <h1>Testing Platform</h1>
            <p>
                A summary of the different platforms (devices and browsers) that your
                testers used.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="section" id="feedback">
            <h1>Feedback Summary</h1>
            <p>
                A summary of the feedback you received organized by question type
                (design, navigation, content, usability, etc.). Highlight both positive comments and
                thoughtful criticism, your client's testimonial, etc.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="section" id="response">
            <h1>Our Response</h1>
            <p>
                Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what you
                could do (once the class is over) to address this feedback with changes in your design or
                implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or suggestions for
                improvements are difficult or impossible to tackle.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section" id="reflection">
            <h1>Self-reflection</h1>
            <p>
                Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you
                learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the nuts-and-bolts of
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this seriously and be thoughtful
                about your comments, but there is no right or wrong answer here, so don't feel that you
                have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to hear.
